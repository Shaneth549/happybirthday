									<h2 class="major">Kobe to my Shaq</h2>
									<p>Firstly, Kobe is the greatest Laker ever so I hope you are flattered hehe. But moving on, I think this is a great comparison. Think about it. I like playing in the post. You like handling the ball. When we play together, I catch your lobs while you (obviously) thrown em to me. I am fatter. You are more athletic. And well since it's your birthday ... you get the prettier wife ;). But in terms of our journeys I think we definetely had our petty episodes back in the day. Almost initiated by your big bro ofcourse AHAH. But we figured ourselves and matured into the best 1-2 punch in our family just like Kobe and Shaq with Laker nation. I certainly wouldn't be here without you. <strong> I just hope you know that I am a bigger and better person with your presence in my life and even if we don't speak everyday like when I was back at home...you are truly in my thoughts and ambitions at every point of my day and I truly care for you with every ounce of my soul.</strong> Why the Batman picture? It was random but I also heard that when Thulana sees you his (little) dark knight rises ;)</p>

									<p><strong>It's hard to find someone with the same interests and values as me. I actually spent an entire lifetime searching for someone like that. But as you grew up I realised that everything I needed in a friend was right with you. Ammi and Thaththi made the absolute right decision and I am beyond thrilled to share pretty much all my interests with you and even have waging wars within those respective interests. It's been a fun 17 years together lil bro. Thankyou for all the memories. No one can replace you as my favourite person to play ball with, watch a movie with or play 2K with(go batshit crazy with)</strong></p>

									<h2 class="major">An inspiration</h2>
									<p>Your constant lookout for growth and the true calmness you possess in your mind inspires me everyday. If you didn't know already I strive to be that level headed every single day and I hope you know that. I am thankful that I was born to parents that taught me how ego doesn't have a seat in our family. If we didn't learn that I would have missed out on a few life changing lessons taught (silently) by you </p>
